# hello-world
I am starting to learn all this coding. This is a new world I have not been in and is exciting. The new powers of coding I feel I missed out. Why did I not learn to code earlier? Why did I not take computer science as part of my major tool kit? Perhaps I was focused a lot on the biological sciences and psychology and rightfully so. Now is the time.
